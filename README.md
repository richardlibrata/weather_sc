This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses OpenWeatherAPI, so change your API key on next.config.mjs to make sure it's working properly.

## Dependencies

This project uses some dependencies, so make sure install some of these dependencies in case there is error on this project:

```bash
npm i react-icons
npm i tailwind-merge clsx
npm i react-query
npm i Axios
npm i date-fns
npm i jotai
```

Or you can check out some dependencies resources in case the installation dependencies code doesn't work:
